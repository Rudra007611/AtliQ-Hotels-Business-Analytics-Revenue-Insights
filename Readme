üè® AtliQ Hotels ‚Äì Business Analytics & Revenue Insights

This project presents a detailed business performance analysis for **AtliQ Hotels**, a fictional hotel chain looking to uncover performance gaps and strategic opportunities using historical booking and revenue data. Through data wrangling, aggregation, and visualization, this project mimics a real-world consulting engagement to deliver insights that can improve revenue, occupancy, and cancellation management.


## üéØ Project Overview

AtliQ Hotels' Strategy Team has raised concerns regarding inconsistent performance across its properties. Despite having data available across key verticals like Rooms, Food & Beverage, Events, and Other Services, decision-makers lack clarity on:

- Which cities or properties are underperforming?

- Which hotel types offer the best ROI?
- When is peak revenue season, and how can it be optimized?

This project analyzes over **20,000+ records** of hotel-level performance data and delivers insight-driven answers to these key questions.


## üìå Business Objectives

- Analyze city-level and property-level revenue distribution
- Benchmark performance across different hotel types
- Identify peak revenue weeks and seasonality patterns
- Quantify loss due to cancellations
- Compare occupancy and customer ratings across geographies
- Examine booking patterns by room type and assess risks
